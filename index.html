            Welcome! Why are you here? I am a first-year math PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. I did my undergrad at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, and I majored in math and computer science with a minor in Japanese. If you ever see me on campus, say hi! I'll probably be wearing a <a href="https://www.sangjunko.com/pic_duck.jpg">duck hat</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I participated in the DIMACS REU in 2021 for the Morse Flow Trees project under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ctw/">Chris Woodward.</a> You can see the website <a href="https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~sk2082/">here</a>, but why would you want to?
