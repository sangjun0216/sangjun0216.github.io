            Welcome! Why are you here? I am a second-year math PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. I did my undergrad at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, and I majored in math and computer science with a minor in Japanese. If you ever see me on campus, say hi! I'll probably be wearing a <a href="https://www.sangjunko.com/pic_duck.jpg">duck hat</a>. (In fact, duck@psu.edu is one of my email aliases!)
        </p>

        <p>
            I participated in the DIMACS REU in 2021 with the project titled "Morse Flow Trees" under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ctw/">Chris Woodward.</a> You can see the website <a href="https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~sk2082/">here</a>.

            <a href=algtop_notes.pdf>Here</a> are some very incomplete notes I typed up for algebraic topology in the spring of 2023. Caveat lector.

            Here is my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> (last updated July 6,2023).
