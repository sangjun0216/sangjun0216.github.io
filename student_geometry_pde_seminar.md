### 10/17/24: Nonlinear Sigma Models (Jake Canel)

How can one study the set of maps from a Riemannian manifold, say the n-sphere, to a highly symmetric manifold, say either a Lie group or its quotients? This question has many answers: homotopy theory, group theory, and geometry all give slightly different suggestions, and many of these are unified through the lens of the Nonlinear Sigma Model.

Originating in the physics literature (Gell-Man and Levy 1960), and finding use there today in descriptions of condensed matter systems and in String Theory, we will discuss

 - Classical, PDE based approaches to this set of maps, corresponding to the classical Nonlinear Sigma Model
 - Statistical, perturbative approaches, more closely corresponding to the quantum case

Both of these discussions will illuminate the beautiful relationship between topology, analysis, and geometry, and hopefully provide motivation for this seminar going forward.
