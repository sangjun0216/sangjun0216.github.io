![a picture of me](Ko,Sangjun-2.jpg "Ko,Sangjun-2.jpg"){: width="200" }

Welcome! Why are you here? I am a second-year math PhD student at Pennsylvania State University.  I did my undergrad at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, and I majored in math and computer science with a minor in Japanese. If you ever see me on campus, say hi! I'll probably be wearing a duck hat like the one in the above photo.  

## Basic Info

- Email: <duck@psu.edu>
- Office: 417 McAllister Building

## CV

My curriculum vitae can be found [here](cv.pdf). 

## Math-related

My current interests are in differential geometry and Lie theory. 

In September 2024 I was at the [GAP XIX conference](https://www1.mat.uniroma1.it/~fiorenza/GAP-Rome/GAP-XIX-2024-Rome.html) in Rome.
