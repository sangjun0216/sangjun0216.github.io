Welcome! Why are you here? I am a second-year math PhD student at Pennsylvania State University.  I did my undergrad at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, and I majored in math and computer science with a minor in Japanese. If you ever see me on campus, say hi! I'll probably be wearing a [duck hat](pic_duck.jpg).
